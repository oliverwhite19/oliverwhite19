## About Me
I am Oliver, a Senior JavaScript Engineer at [FullScript](https://fullscript.com/), where I work on improving the patient experience on web and on mobile. I previously worked at [Welbi](https://www.welbi.co/) and [LouGeek](https://louisvillegeek.com/). I have experience with PHP and Laravel, Express and Typescript, but now I work with React, React Native and Ruby on Rails!

## What am I doing?
- 👷 I'm currently working with Remix to rebuild some of my projects
- 🛤 I have a passion for public transit, in particular trains, so if you have a project for that let me know!
- 🥞 My current stack is remix + mongodb + vercel: clean, fast and easy
- 🧑‍💻 My pronouns are he/him
